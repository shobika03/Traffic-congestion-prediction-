 Traffic Congestion Prediction

This project focuses on predicting traffic congestion levels using machine learning and deep learning techniques.  
It analyzes traffic patterns such as time, day, and vehicle count to forecast congestion levels.  
The goal is to support traffic management systems and smart city planning with accurate, data-driven predictions.

Features
- Predicts traffic congestion based on historical and time-series data  
- Implements both Random Forest and LSTM models for comparison  
- Provides visual insights through graphs and plots  
- Designed with a simple and modular codebase for future scalability

Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy – for data preprocessing  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data visualization  
- Scikit-learn – for Random Forest model  
- TensorFlow / Keras – for LSTM deep learning model  
- Streamlit – for web-based interface
